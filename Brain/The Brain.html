            <p>
                With rounded lobes and intricate folds, the cerebral cortex is the largest and most recognizable part of the brain. From pereception to decision making, language, conseciousness and human experience lives here. In the cerebral cortex about 16 billion neurons and 60 billion glia arranged into six layers that guide the development of useful neural circuits.Also, contain the cell bodies of neurons and constitute the brain's signal processing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter#:~:text=Grey%20matter%20contains%20most%20of,making%2C%20and%20self%2Dcontrol.">"grey matter"</a>
                <br>
                The cerebral cortex is divided into two nearly symmetrical hemispheres, which are joined by a thick bridge of white tissue called the <a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/3d-brain#intro=false&amp;focus=Brain-corpus_callosum" target="_blank"> "corpus callocum" </a>. Each hemisphere is comprised of four lobes containing discrete regions that carry out specific functions, some of them are shared by redundant areas in both hemispheres, while the other are focused in a single hemisphere.
                <br>
                The Cerebral Cortex is divided into:

            <h3 id="1">1.The Frontal Lobe </h3>
            <img src="tempsnip2.PNG" alt="">
            <p>
                It's the largest lobe of the cerebral cortex, and is responsible many of behavioral traiats that we consider uniquely human, includung personality, decision making, motor control and such those things, you surly know what I mean.
                <br>
                The frontal lobe makes sense of information about environment, memories, and emotions, and it uses those informations to make decisions. To accomplish this, the frontal lobe maintains connections to nearly every part of the brain, filtering vast amounts of information to ensure we focus only on relevant ones-without it we wouldn't have much of an attention span.
                <br>
                The frontal lobe also provides us with working memory, which keeps relevant information available for a short period of time in order to make complex decisions.
            </p>
            <h3>Frontal Lobe is divided into:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt> <strong>Orbitofrontal Cortex</strong> </dt>
                <dd>It helps us understand the consequences of complex behaviors and adjust those behaviors to reach a specific desired outcome, particularly in the context of the social behavior.</dd>
                <dd>Problems in the <em>Orbitofrontal Cortex</em> have also been linked to depression.for extra information <a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/~/link.aspx?_id=913A37CEC9524CA8B24B1F5EB4086B2B&amp;_z=z">click here.</a> </dd>
                <dt> <strong>Premotor Cortex</strong> </dt>
                <dd>The premotor cortex, which is located just anterior to the primary motor cortex, is involved in planning and organizing movements and actions. Neuronal activity in prefrontal and premotor areas precedes activation of the primary motor cortex and neurons in the spinal cord. Parts of the cerebellum (ascending pathways) also become active before the primary motor cortex during the planning of a movement, whereas other parts of the cerebellum (descending pathways), involved in motor execution, become active after the motor cortex.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>Middle Frontal Gyrus</strong> </dt>
                <dd>The middle frontal gyrus is a wide gyrus that lies between the superior and the inferior frontal sulci, rostral to the precentral gyrus. The sulci of the middle frontal gyrus have generated a lot of confusion in the anatomical literature. In the anterior part of the middle frontal gyrus lies a deep sulcus that has been referred to as the middle frontal sulcus or the intermediate frontal sulcus. This sulcus was studied in detail by Eberstaller (1890).</dd>
                <dt> <strong>Interior Frontal Gyrus</strong> </dt>
                <dd>The inferior frontal gyrus makes up the lateral and inferior surface of the frontal lobe and is separated from the middle frontal gyrus above by the inferior frontal sulcus. It contains the frontal operculum (hiding the anterosuperior part of the insular cortex).ts inferior edge abuts the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure), which gives off two branches that subdivide the inferior frontal gyrus into three parts.  From anterior to posterior: the anterior ramus (a.k.a. anterior horizontal ramus) separates the pars orbitalis from the pars triangularis, and the ascending ramus (aka anterior ascending ramus) separates the pars triangularis form the pars opercularis.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>Prefrontal Cortex</strong> </dt>
                <dd>The prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain located at the front of the frontal lobe. It is implicated in a variety of complex behaviors, including planning, and greatly contributes to personality development.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>Motor Cortex</strong> </dt>                    <dd>The motor cortex is an area within the cerebral cortex of the brain that is involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements. The motor cortex can be divided into the primary motor cortex and the nonprimary motor cortex.The primary motor cortex is critical for initiating motor movements. The nonprimary motor cortex, which is further divided into other areas such as the premotor and supplementary cortex, is involved with aspects of planning, initiating, and selecting the correct movement.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>Borca's Area</strong> </dt>
                <dd>The primary functions of the Broca area are both language production and comprehension. While the exact role in the production is still unclear, many believe that it directly impacts the motor movements to allow for speech. Although originally thought to only aid in speech production, lesions in the area can rarely be related to impairments in the comprehension of language. Different regions of the Broca area specialize in various aspects of comprehension. The anterior portion helps with semantics, or word meaning, while the posterior is associated with phonology, or how words sound. The Broca area is also necessary for language repetition, gesture production, sentence grammar and fluidity, and the interpretation of others' actions.</dd>

            <h3 id="2">2.The Occipital Lobe</h3>
            <img src="tempsnip3.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Understanding the occipital lobe requires a basic understanding of brain anatomy. The cerebral cortex of the brain—a part of the brain shared by all vertebrates—is the newest part of the brain, evolutionarily speaking. All mammalian brains have four distinct lobes, but the brain itself—as well as the lobes it contains—is divided into right and left hemispheres. This means that each lobe can actually be divided into two parts. The occipital lobe includes a right and left lobe that interact with one another, each controlling a range of visual functions.Researchers once thought that the occipital lobe only controlled visual functions. But in recent years, they discovered that some portions of this lobe receive inputs from other brain regions. Specifically, a brain region called the dorsomedial stream receives input both from regions of the brain related to vision, and to areas that are not linked to visual processing. This suggests either that the occipital lobe may perform additional functions, or that researchers have not identified all regions of the brain associated with visual processing.
                <br>
                Like all other lobes of the brain, the occipital lobe contains a number of structures and neuronal tracts that work together to enable vision. Those include:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt> <strong>Brodmann area 17</strong> </dt>
                <dd>Known as V1, this region is located in the occipital lobe's calcarine sulcus, and serves as the brain's primary visual cortex. It aids the brain to determine location, spatial information, and color data.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>The ventral stream</strong> </dt>
                <dd> Known sometimes as V2, this is a secondary visual cortex that helps the brain assign meaning to what it is seeing. Without V2, you would still be able to see, but would have no conscious awareness of or understanding of the sights your eyes took in.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>The dorsomedial stream</strong> </dt>                   <dd> Neuroscientists don't yet have a strong understanding of this brain region, which connects to both V1 and V2, as well as other brain regions.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>The lateral geniculate bodies</strong> </dt>
                <dd> These structures take in optic information from retinal sensors in each eye, sending raw information to each visual cortex.</dd>
                <dt> <strong>Lingula</strong> </dt>
                <dd> this area receives information from the contralateral inferior retina to gather information about the field of vision.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3 id="3">3.The Pareital Lobe</h3>
            <img src="capture.PNG" alt="">
            <p>
                The parietal lobe integrates information from our senses to focus our attention on umportant things in the environment. It interprets our sense of touch [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system">somatosensation</a>] and monitors the relative position of the body and its limbs [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">proprioception</a>]. The parietal lobe also receives signals from the occipital lobe that reflect the location of objects in our visual field, which it reconciles with touch and body position to paint a realistic picture of our surroundings
                <br>
                The parietal lobe accounts for only 19% of the total neocortical volume (marginally larger than the occipital lobe). The lobe extends from the central sulcus anteriorly, which separates it from the frontal lobe, to the parieto-occipital fissure posteriorly, which separates it from the occipital lobe. The lateral sulcus corresponds to its inferolateral boundary, separating it from the temporal lobe. Medially, it is confined by the medial longitudinal fissure which divides both cerebral hemispheres.
            </p>

            <h3 id="4">4.The Temporal lobe</h3>
            <img src="tempsnip.png" alt="">
            <p>The temporal lobe is one of the four main lobes or regions of the cerebral cortex. It is located in the largest division of the brain known as the forebrain [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forebrain">prosencephalon</a>]. As with the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes, there is one temporal lobe located in each brain hemisphere.This vital structure helps process sensory input, including pain and auditory stimuli. It also helps you understand language, retain visual memories, and both process and remember emotions.Damage to this region of the brain can have global consequences for virtually every bodily function, since much of what we do depends on emotions and sensory input.</p>

            <h3 id="5">5.The Cingulate Cortex</h3>
            <img src="tempsnip1.png" alt="">
            <p>
                The cingulate cortex is a fascinating area of the human brain that has attracted a lot of recent attention. It resides within the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and is perhaps most well known as being part of the limbic system. It is involved in many vital neural circuits, which include other structures such as reward centers, amygdala, lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, motor areas, spinal cord, hippocampus, and limbic regions. Although previously viewed as a mysterious territory of the brain, evidence from cognitive and fMRI studies has established a better understanding of the cingulate cortex in the last decade. Its functional role continues to be heavily studied to this day. In the following sections, we shed more light on the cingulate cortical structure, function, and clinical and surgical significance
                <br>
                anterior cerebral artery supplies the majority of the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, including the cingulate gyrus. As a direct continuation of the anterior cerebral artery, the pericallosal artery travels within the callosal sulcus and gives off many small cortical branches that supply the rostrum of the cingulate gyrus. The callomarginal artery, the largest branch of the anterior cerebral artery, runs within the cingulate sulcus and supplies the portion of the cingulate gyrus underlying the paracentral lobule. Posteriorly, the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus receive vascular supply from the precuneal artery, a branch of the pericallosal artery.
